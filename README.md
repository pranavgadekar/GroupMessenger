# GroupMessenger

Totally and Causally Ordered Group Messenger with a Local Persistent Key-Value Table

This application builds on the simple messenger app. This is a group messenger application that preserves total ordering as well as causal ordering of all messages. In addition, it implements a key-value table that each device uses to individually store all messages on its local storage.
